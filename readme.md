I used MIcrosoft Visual Studio 2012 for coding and to provide access to database I used System.Data.SQLite library.

This project require the appropriate version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library, to be successfully installed on the target machine, prior to making use of the executables contained therein. It should also be noted that the downloadable packages on this web page that include the word "setup" (i.e. the setup packages) already include and will attempt to automatically install the required version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library.
